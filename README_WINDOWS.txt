# Windows Quick Start

If double-clicking `.js` files opens Java or a warning, that's a Windows file association issue.
You **do not** need to open `.js` files directly.

## One‑click run
1) Double‑click `RUN_ME_ON_WINDOWS.bat` in this folder.
2) It checks Node.js, runs `npm install`, and starts the dev server.
3) Open http://localhost:3000 if your browser doesn't open automatically.

## Install Node.js
- Get the LTS version from https://nodejs.org/

## Recommended editor
- Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- In VS Code: File → Open Folder… → select this folder.

## (Optional) Fix `.js` association to VS Code
Settings → Apps → Default apps → Choose defaults by file type → `.js` → choose “Visual Studio Code” or “Notepad”.
